# MD

The [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Viewer - version 0.3


## Instalation

Use curl or wget to download [Markdown.pl](http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip) script. Then set it as an executable
and copy it somewhere on your *$PATH*.

    $ curl -O http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip
    $ unzip Markdown_1.0.1.zip
    $ cd Markdown_1.0.1
    $ chmod +x Markdown.pl
    $ sudo cp Markdown.pl /usr/local/bin

Finally, get **md** script, set is as an executable file and copy it like above:

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/szw/md/master/md
    $ chmod +x md
    $ sudo mv md /usr/local/bin


## Usage

    md your_markdown_file.md

or (if you want just the generated HTML):

    md your_markdown_file.md your_target_file.html

In the second case, the generated file will not be opened in the browser.

Examples:

    $ md README.md
    $ md my_text.markdown
    ...

In Vim you might use:

    :!md filename

### Mathematics

The viewer can also render math formulas using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). For more information about the Math rendering check [this MathJax quick reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).


## Vim snippet

You can easily integrate **md** with Vim. The following snippet set **md** as
a Vim command, accessed via `:Md`:

    au FileType markdown command! -buffer -nargs=0 Md :silent! :exe '! md "' . expand('%:p') . '"' | redraw!


## Sublime Text 3 Build System

You can easily plugin the viewer into [ST3 Build System](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/build_systems.html). Create a file in your `Packages/User` directory (on macOS it could be `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`) named `Markdown\ Preview.sublime-build` the following content:

    {
        "selector": "text.html.markdown",
        "working_dir": "$project_path",
        "path": "~/.local/bin",
        "shell_cmd": "md $file"
    }

_`path` is necessary only if you put `md` in a non-standard place (like here `~/.local/bin`)._

Afterwards, you can easily render Markdown by pressing (in case of macOS) <code>&#8984;</code> + `B`.

If you have more Markdown related build systems already, you can change the default one using <code>&#8679;</code> + <code>&#8984;</code> + `B`.
