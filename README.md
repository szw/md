# MD

The [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Viewer - version 0.3


## Instalation

Use curl or wget to download [Markdown.pl](http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip) script.  Then set it as an executable
and copy it somewhere on your *$PATH*.

    $ curl -O http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip
    $ unzip Markdown_1.0.1.zip
    $ cd Markdown_1.0.1
    $ chmod +x Markdown.pl
    $ sudo cp Markdown.pl /usr/local/bin

Finally, get **md** script, set is as an executable file and copy it like above:

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/szw/md/master/md
    $ chmod +x md
    $ sudo mv md /usr/local/bin

For MDM (Markdown Math Viewer) get **mdm**:

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/szw/md/master/mdm
    $ chmod +x mdm
    $ sudo mv mdm /usr/local/bin

## Usage

    md your_markdown_file.md
    mdm your_math_file.md

or (if you want just the generated HTML):

    md your_markdown_file.md your_target_file.html

In the second case, the generated file will not be opened in the browser.

Examples:

    $ md README.md
    $ md my_text.markdown
    ...

In Vim you might use:

    :!md filename


## Vim snippet

You can easily integrate **md** with Vim. The following snippet set **md** as
a Vim command, accessed via `:Md`:

    au FileType markdown command! -buffer -nargs=0 Md :silent! :exe '! md "' . expand('%:p') . '"' | redraw!


## Sublime Text 3 Build System

You can easily plugin the viewers into ST3 Build System:

Create 2 files in your `Packages/User` directory (on macOS it will be `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User`):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>File Name</th><th>Content</th><th>Comments</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>Markdown\ Preview.sublime-build</code></td>
            <td>
                <pre><code>{
    "selector": "text.html.markdown",
    "working_dir": "$project_path",
    "path": "~/.local/bin",
    "shell_cmd": "md $file"
}</code></pre></td>
            <td rowspan="2"><code>path</code> is necessary only if you put <code>md</code> (<code>mdd</code>) in a non-standard place (like here <code>~/.local/bin</code>)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>Markdown\ Math\ Preview.sublime-build</code></td>
            <td><pre><code>{
    "selector": "text.html.markdown",
    "working_dir": "$project_path",
    "path": "~/.local/bin",
    "shell_cmd": "mdm $file"
}</code></pre></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Afterwards, you can easily render Markdown by pressing (in case of macOS) <code>&#8984;</code> + `B`.

To change the default viewer use <code>&#8679;</code> + <code>&#8984;</code> + `B`.
